/**
 * Transforms given {@link module:engine/model/operation/operation~Operation operation}
 * by another {@link module:engine/model/operation/operation~Operation operation}
 * and returns the result of that transformation as an array containing
 * one or more {@link module:engine/model/operation/operation~Operation operations}.
 *
 * Operations work on specified positions, passed to them when they are created.
 * Whenever {@link module:engine/model/document~Document document}
 * changes, we have to reflect those modifications by updating or "transforming" operations which are not yet applied.
 * When an operation is transformed, its parameters may change based on the operation by which it is transformed.
 * If the transform-by operation applied any modifications to the Tree Data Model which affect positions or nodes
 * connected with transformed operation, those changes will be reflected in the parameters of the returned operation(s).
 *
 * Whenever the {@link module:engine/model/document~Document document}
 * has different {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#version}
 * than the operation you want to {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#applyOperation apply}, you need to transform that
 * operation by all operations which were already applied to the {@link module:engine/model/document~Document document} and have greater
 * {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#version} than the operation being applied. Transform them in the same order as those
 * operations which were applied. This way all modifications done to the Tree Data Model will be reflected
 * in the operation parameters and the operation will "operate" on "up-to-date" version of the Tree Data Model.
 * This is mostly the case with Operational Transformations but it might be needed in particular features as well.
 *
 * In some cases, when given operation apply changes to the same nodes as this operation, two or more operations need
 * to be created as one would not be able to reflect the combination of these operations.
 * This is why an array is returned instead of a single object. All returned operations have to be applied
 * (or further transformed) to get an effect which was intended in pre-transformed operation.
 *
 * Sometimes two operations are in conflict. This happens when they modify the same node in a different way, i.e.
 * set different value for the same attribute or move the node into different positions. When this happens,
 * we need to decide which operation is more important. We can't assume that operation `a` or operation `b` is always
 * more important. In Operational Transformations algorithms we often need to get a result of transforming
 * `a` by `b` and also `b` by `a`. In both transformations the same operation has to be the important one. If we assume
 * that first or the second passed operation is always more important we won't be able to solve this case.
 *
 * @external module:engine/model/model.operation
 * @function module:engine/model/operation/transform~transform

 * @param {module:engine/model/operation/operation~Operation} b Operation to transform by.
